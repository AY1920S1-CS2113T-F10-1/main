== Introduction

**ModPlan**

Your one stop solution to module planning through out your university tenure! +
ModPlan is a module planning system that expands on NUSMODS to help NUS Computer Engineering students to plan their modules for all four years of their bachelor's degree.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `ModPlan.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ModPlan application.
//.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`show module`* : shows all modules
* **`add`**`module CG2028` : searches for a module with a module code of CG2028 and adds the module into the module list
* **`remove`**`module 3` : deletes the 3rd module shown in the module list
* *`bye`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add module MOD_CODE`, `MOD_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `add module CG1112` or `add module GES1012`.
//* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
//* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Adding a module or CCA: `add`

Adds the specified module or CCA to the module list or CCA list respectively.

==== Searching and adding a module: `add module`

Searchs for a module and adds it to the module list, if the module is present in the list of NUS modules. +
Format: `add module MOD_CODE`

****
* The `MOD_CODE` must be in the format of the NUS module code name.
* Example: `add module CG2028`
****

==== Adding CCA : `add cca`

Adds a CCA task into the CCA list. +
Format: `add cca CCA_NAME --begin BEGIN_TIME --end END_TIME --dayOfWeek DAY_OF_WEEK`

=== Removing a module or CCA : `remove`

Removes the specified module or CCA.

==== Removing a module : `remove module`

Removes the specified module from the module list. +
Format: `remove module INDEX`

****
* Removes the module at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed module list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

* `show` +
`remove 2` +
Removes the 2nd module in the module list.

==== Removing a CCA: `remove cca`

Removes a CCA which is added. +
Format: `remove cca INDEX`

=== Listing modules or cca : `show`

Shows a list of specificed modules or ccas added in the module or cca list respectively.

==== Listing all modules : `show module`

Shows a list of all modules added in the module list. +
Format: `show module`

****
* Shows the module code, the number of MCs of the module and if the module can be SU-ed. 
****

==== Giving a report on core modules: `show core`

Prints out a report on all the core modules taken in the semester. +
Format: `show core`

==== Giving a report on general education modules: `show ge`

Prints out a report on all the general education modules taken in the semester. +
Format: `show ge`

==== Giving a report on unrestricted electives modules: `show ue`

Prints out a report on all the unrestricted electives modules taken in the semester. +
Format: `show ue`

==== Listing all CCAs: `show cca`

Shows a list of all CCAs added in the cca list. + 
Format: `show cca`

=== Calculating the CAP : `cap`

Calculates your overall CAP or predicted CAP in different ways.

==== Calculating CAP from user input. +
Format: `cap overall`

****
* Typing `cap overall` into the command line shows a CAP calculation message.
* Type the module taken, along with it's letter grade. +
Keep typing all the module names in the module list and their respective grades with the format shown below
* Format: `MOD_CODE GRADE_LETTER`
* Type `done` when you are ready to calculate the CAP.
* ModPlan then shows your current cumulative or predicated CAP.
****

Example: +
`cap overall` + 
`CG2028 A` +
`CS2027 B-` + 
`done`

==== Calculating CAP from the module list. +
Format: `cap list`

****
* Type `cap list` into the command line.
* ModPlan will show you your list of modules and grades to calculate CAP from.
* ModPlan will then calculate your CAP based on the completed modules in your module list.
** Note that S/U'ed modules or modules without a grade will not be used in the calculation.
****

Example: +
`cap list`

==== Calculating predicted CAP of a module from it's prerequesites. +
Format: `cap module`

****
* Type `cap module` into the command line.
* ModPlan will then prompt you for the module to calculate CAP for.
* Type the module code of the module you wish to predict your CAP for.
* ModPlan will automatically sort the prerequisites of that module and check for your grades in them.
** Note that these prerequisites have to be added and graded in your module list.
** If any prerequisites are not completed, ModPlan will print a list of the prerequisites you have yet to complete/give a grade for.
****

Example: +
`cap module` +
`CS2040C`

=== Grading your modules: `grade`

Allows you to input your letter grade received for the modules you have taken. +
Format: `grade MODULECODE LETTERGRADE`

****
* Type `grade MODULECODE LETTERGRADE` into the command line, replacing `MODULECODE` with an actual module code, and `LETTERGRADE` with the grade you received for that module.
* ModPlan will either update the grade of the module if it is in your list, or add the module with the letter grade included if it is not in your list.
* ModPlan will also check if the module is S/U-able, and will allow the user to input S and U grades accordingly.
** If the module is not S/U-able, ModPlan will inform the user if they try to input a S or U grade.
****

Example: +
`grade CS1010 A-` +
`grade CS1231 S`

=== Sorting and printing the modules or ccas : `sort`

Sorts out modules or ccas accordingly.

==== Sorting and printing the modules : `sort module`

Sorts the module list according to alphabetical order and numerical order and prints the module list. + 
Format: `sort module`

==== Sorting and printing the CCAs : `sort cca`

Sorts the cca list according to alphabetical order and prints the cca list. + 
Format: `sort cca` 

=== Clearing the data : `clear`

Clears the specified data.

==== Clearing the modules data : `clear modules`

Clears and empties the list of modules being added. +
Format: `clear modules`

==== Clearing the CCA data : `clear ccas`

Clears and empties the list of modules being added. +
Format: `clear ccas`

=== Adding schedule to a CCA : `scheduleCca`

Add additional schedule to a CCA which was added. +
Format: `scheduleCca INDEX --begin BEGIN_TIME --end END_TIME --DAY_OF_WEEK`

Exits the program. +
Format: `bye`

****
* Typing `bye` into the command line shows a goodbye message, saves the module list, and closes the program.
****

=== Saving the data

Task list data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

[[Errors]]
== Errors
*Error Handling*
* When the user inputs commands or parameters in a way that the program does not understand, errors will be thrown, which let the user know what is wrong.

[TIP]
If you follow what the errors tell you to fix in your command, you can get the program to work as intended!

=== `ModBadRequestStatus`
This error appears when there is bad internet connection. The information from the nusMods V2 API is not fully fetched.

Example of error message: `Error: Bad Status Connection!`

=== `ModFailedJsonException`
This error appears when the file from the nusMods V2 API is not correctly converted for Java usage.

Example of error message: `Error: Failed to parse data file!`

=== `ModNotFoundException`
This error appears when the user searches for a module code that is not found in the nusMod list.

=== `ModCommandException`
This error appears when the user does not input a valid command name into the command line.

=== `ModCcaScheduleException`
This error appears when the user inputs a CCA whose time period clashes with another CCA.

Example of error message:`Error: This CCA clashes with existing CCA!`

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Data folder.

== Command Summary

* *Add* `add MOD_CODE` +
