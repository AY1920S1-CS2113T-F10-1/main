== Introduction

**ModPlan**

Your one stop solution to module planning through out your university tenure! +
ModPlan is a module planning system that expands on NUSMODS to help NUS Computer Engineering students to plan their modules for all four years of their bachelor's degree.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `ModPlan.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ModPlan application.
//.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all tasks
* **`add`**`todo finish homework` : adds a Todo task with the description `finish homework` to the task list.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list
* *`bye`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add TASK_TYPE`, `TASK_TYPE` is a parameter which can be used as `add todo` or `add deadline`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` can be used as `find book` or as `find book read`.
//* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
//* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

=== Searching and adding a module: `add`

Searchs for a module and adds it to the module list, if the module is present in the list of NUS modules. +
Format: `add MOD_NAME`

****
* The `MOD_NAME` must be in the format of the NUS module code name.
* Example: `add CG2028`
****

// tag::remove[]
=== Removing a module : `remove`

Removes the specified module from the module list. +
Format: `remove INDEX`

****
* Removes the module at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed module list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

* `show` +
`remove 2` +
Removes the 2nd module in the module list.

// end::remove[]

=== Listing all modules : `show`

Shows a list of all modules added in the module list. +
Format: `show`

****
* Shows the module code, the number of MCs of the module and if the module can be SU-ed. +
****

=== Calculating the CAP : `cap`

Calculates the overall CAP or predicted CAP.
Format: `cap`

****
* Typing `cap` into the command line shows a CAP calculation message.
* Type the module taken, along with it's letter grade. Keep typing all the module names in the module list and their respective grades. 
* Format: `MOD_NAME GRADE_LETTER`
* Type `done` when you are ready to calculate the CAP.
* Shows your current cumulative or predicated CAP.
****

Example: +
`cap` + 
`CG2028 A` +
`CS2027 B-` + 
`done`

=== Sorting and printing the modules: `print`

Sorts the module list according to alphabetical order and numerical order and prints the module list.+ 
Format: `print`

=== Giving a report on the types of modules: `report`

Gives a report and the specified type of modules taken.

==== Giving a report on core modules: `core`

Prints out a report on all the core modules taken in the semester.+
Format: `report core`

==== Giving a report on general education modules: `core`

Prints out a report on all the general education modules taken in the semester.+
Format: `report ge`

==== Giving a report on unrestricted electives modules: `core`

Format: `report ue`

=== Adding CCA: `addCca`

Adds a CCA task into the cca list. 
Format: `addCca CCA_NAME --begin BEGIN_TIME --end END_TIME --DAY_OF_WEEK`

=== Rescheduling CCA: `scheduleCca`

Reschedules a CCA which is added.

[[Errors]]
== Errors
*Error Handling*
* When the user inputs commands or parameters in a way that the program does not understand, errors will be thrown, which let the user know what is wrong.

[TIP]
If you follow what the errors tell you to fix in your command, you can get the program to work as intended!

=== `ModBadRequestStatus`
This error appears when there is bad internet connection. The information from the nusMods V2 API is not fully fetched.

Example of error message:`Error: Bad Status Connection!`

=== `ModFailedJsonException`
This error appears when the file from the nusMods V2 API is not correctly converted for Java usage.

Example of error message:`Error: Failed to parse data file!`

=== `ModNotFoundException`
This error appears when the user searches for a module code that is not found in the nusMod list.

****
* Example: `add CS111`
* Example of error message: 
image::ModNotFoundException.png[width="250"]
****

=== `ModCommandException`
This error appears when the user does not input a valid command name into the command line.

=== `ModCcaScheduleException`
This error appears when the user inputs a CCA whose time period clashes with another CCA.

Example of error message:`Error: This CCA clashes with existing CCAs!`

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Data folder.
