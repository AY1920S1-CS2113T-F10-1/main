== Introduction

*ModPlan*

ModPlan is a module planning system that expands on NUSMODS to help NUS students to plan their modules for all four years of their bachelorâ€™s degree. +
ModPlan is currently only designed to work for Computer Engineering students, and the requisite modules for graduation. +
ModPlan uses NUSMODS API to extract module data from the official NUS Registrar's Office, 
This Developer Guide is meant for any software developer who wishes to contribute to or test the ModPlan project, and can find architecture, implementation methods and high-level design considerations within this file.
