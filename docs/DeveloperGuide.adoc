== Introduction

*ModPlan*

ModPlan is a module planning system that expands on NUSMODS to help NUS students to plan their modules for all four years of their bachelorâ€™s degree.  +
ModPlan is currently only designed to work for Computer Engineering students, and the requisite modules for graduation. +
ModPlan uses NUSMODS API to extract official module data from the NUS Registrar's Office. + 
This Developer Guide is meant for any software developer who wishes to contribute to or test ModPlan, and can find architecture, implementation methods and high-level design considerations within this file.
