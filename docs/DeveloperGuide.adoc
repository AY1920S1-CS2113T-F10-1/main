== Introduction

*ModPlan*

ModPlan is a module planning system that expands on NUSMODS to help NUS students to plan their modules for all four years of their bachelorâ€™s degree.  +

ModPlan is currently only designed to work for Computer Engineering students, and the requisite modules for graduation. +
ModPlan uses NUSMODS API to extract official module data from the NUS Registrar's Office. + 

This Developer Guide is meant for any software developer who wishes to contribute to or test ModPlan, and can find architecture, implementation methods and high-level design considerations within this file.

== Setting up

**Prerequisites**

* JDK version:  `11` or above
* Recommended IDE: `IntelliJ IDEA`
* Fork this repo to your GitHub account and clone the fork to your computer

**Importing the project into IntelliJ**

1. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
2. Set up the correct JDK version.
   * Click `Configure` > `Structure for new Projects` (in older versions of Intellij:`Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`).
   * If JDK 11 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 11.
   * Click `OK`.
3. Click `Import Project`.
4. Locate the project directory and click `OK`.
5. Select `Create project from existing sources` and click `Next`.
6. Rename the project if you want. Click `Next`.
7. Ensure that your src folder is checked. Keep clicking `Next`.
8. Click `Finish`.

**Running the Project**

* If you wish to run the .jar file in a mainstream OS, simply double click the .jar file, and a command line interface should run in a few seconds. +
This is assuming you have a JDK version of `11` and above.

* If you are not using `gradle`, simply locate the `Planner.java` file under `PROJECT_DIRECTORY/src/main/java/planner/Planner.java`, and run it in your IDE.

* If you are using `gradle`, import the project as a gradle project using the `Import Gradle Project` function in IntelliJ, and run `gradlew run` from the command line.

== Overall Design

=== Architecture

Our integration approach would be bottom-up, since we are morphing the original Duke Assistant into our ModPlanner application, some of the components can be adapted and reused of other purposes. +

The high-level UML Diagram of ModPlan can be seen below:

image::Architecture.png[]

In that way, our implementation approach would also be incremental as oppose to big-bang, since we would need to gradually alter and test out which portions of Duke is reusable in ModPlanner.



=== JsonWrapper

The main wrapper over requesting data from NUSMODS API, Gson library for JSON parsing. Dependant on Storage class for writing data files obtained.

image::JsonWrapper.png[width="350"]

This class is also dependant on a RequestsData class which serves as the main API caller for ModPlanner, but it is not used anywhere else in the code base.

=== Storage

Main class which handles file writing during runtime and for maintaining user data in memory.

image::Storage.png[width="350"]

This class was adapted from the existing Duke storage to suit the needs of ModPlanner.

[[Parser]]

=== Parser

Parser is implemented as `Parser` class (formerly named `Argparse4jWrapper`, hence the name in the diagrams) which is a wrapper for the `argparse4j` library to handle user input and manage internal command mapping.

image::Parser.png[]

=== PlannerUi

The main class which handles user display, which includes reading user input and printing module, CAP and CCA information back to the user on command-line.

image::PlannerUi.png[]

=== Command

Commands are the main classes with which we execute our features. All of the specific `Command` classes inherit the base `ModuleCommand` abstract class, and utilize its `execute` method. 

The execute method takes in the detailed map of modules drawn from the NUSMODS API Json file, module task list, cca list, planner UI, storage, and the jsonWrapper parser. Each execute method is overriden in the specific Command classes to do what the feature requires of the class.

The `ModuleCommand` class also receives arguments based on the arguments passed by the `Parser` class, which is our main parser for the program, detailed above in <<Parser>>. 
+
These arguments change how some of the classes function as well, using a switch case system to sort through the different argument types received. These will changes will be explained further under the Implementation section here <<Implementation>>.

image::Command.png[]

=== CCA

CCA is implemented as `Cca` class which is the backbone for representing and managing user-defined CCAs. Typically, CCAs are loaded and stored in an `List`-like structure implemented in `CcaList` class which inherits from the builtin `ArrayList`.

image::CCA.png[]

[[Implementation]]

== Implementation
This section explains and shows diagrams of how certain features of ModPlan are implemented.

=== Parser
User inputs are recorded by `PlannerUi` and then handled and interpreted by `Parser` class, which is a wrapper for the `argparse4j` library for customized parsing behaviours such as command calling or custom `Action` definition.

==== Current implementation

[[Attributes]]

===== Attributes

`Parser` (formerly `Argparse4jWrapper`) relies on two major `private` variables `commandMapper` which has the type `HashMap<String, Class<? extends ModuleCommand>>` and `parser` which is an instance of `ArgumentParser`.

Additionally, `Parser` also has attribute `subParserManager` which is the `Subparsers` object associated with `parser` and `subParsers` which is of type `HashMap<String, Subparser>`. Any `Subparser` object added by `subParserManager` should be added to `subParser` as new value with its name as the key for ease of retrieval.

* `parser` is the parent parser for all user inputs, any commands implemented must be parsed using a `Subparser` object added by `subParserManager` as described above.

* `commandMapper` is the `HashMap` which maps the command name (which is often the same as the `subParser` 's name and the key in `subParser`) to the corresponding `ModuleCommand` class.

`Parser` also support custom `Action` objects for custom parsing behaviours which implementation and usage details can be found in `argparse4j` 's documentation.

===== Methods
There are several "init" methods which would be called on every new instance of `Parser`:

* `private void initBuiltinActions()` initializes all builtin `Action` objects necessary for normal parsing of builtin commands.

* `private void mapBuiltinCommands()` maps builtin commands and corresponding classes using `commandMapper` as described in <<Attributes>>.

* `private void initBuiltinParsers()` initializes all `Subparser` objects for builtin commands.

* `private void mapBuiltinParserArguments()` specifies all arguments and properties for `Subparser` objects generated by `initBuiltinParsers`.

===== Operation
`Parser` provides several methods for parsing inputs:

* `parseCommand` takes in a `String` object as argument and returns an object that inherits from `ModuleCommand` (dynamic type) corresponding to the input received or `null` if the input is invalid. If any `ModuleCommand` object invoked `throw` a `ModException` object, the exception will be re-`throw`. This is the method used by ModPlanner to parse commands and invoke the corresponding `ModuleCommand` classes.

* `parse` returns a `Namespace` object containing all the parsed arguments instead. It has several overloaded implementations:

** `public Namespace parse(String[] args)`

** `public Namespace parse(String userInput)`

** `public Namespace parse(String subParserName, String[] args)`

** `public Namespace parse(String subParserName, String userInput)`

`subParserName`, if specified when calling, will tell `Parser` to look for the corresponding `Subparser` object associated with `parser` as mapped in `subParsers` for parsing instead of using `parser`.

Parsing errors are handled by a `private` `handleError` method and only the logs are printed to `stdout`.

Note that during execution of `parseCommand`, to initialize a `ModuleCommand` object, `Parser` will initialize an `Arguments` object from the parsed `Namespace` object to feed into the `ModuleCommand` object's constructor. However, `Arguments` is not a required class for `Parser` 's `parse` method to work.

An sequence diagram for `parseCommand` can be found below.

image::ParseCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

The `ModuleCommand` class is not seen in the diagram because `Parser` might not call any `ModuleCommand`-type objects. The only guarantee is that an object with class that inherits from `ModuleCommand` will be returned.

==== Design consideration
As the `argparse4j` 's library itself is very robust and powerful, we currently have no plan to modify `Parser` 's implementation. However, addition of custom `Action` will be considered as currently only `Join` is being used for parsing of multiple words `String` arguments.

***

=== GradeCommand
==== Current Implementation
The `grade` feature is operated by the `GradeCommand` class, which is called by the `Parser` class. Upon user input of `grade MODULECODE LETTERGRADE`, the Parser will return a new `GradeCommand`.

Since `GradeCommand` inherits the `ModuleCommand` class, it must override the `execute` method to specially execute the `grade` command.
From the `Parser`, `GradeCommand` also receives two additional variable inputs from the user: +

. The module code of the module to be graded.
. The letter grade attained for the module that the user specifies above.

There are two ways that the execute method can execute, depending upon whether the moduleCode the user enters is in their moduleTaskList or not.

****

* Case 1: Module is not in the task list +
If the module is not in the task list, `GradeCommand` executes in a similar fashion to `SearchThenAddCommand`, creating a temporary `ModuleInfoDetailed` class to check if the moduleCode entered by the user exists or not. +
Following which, the letterGrade of the module is set using the method `setGrade` under the `ModuleInfoDetailed` class.
+
** *Note:* The `setGrade` method will check if the letterGrade input by the user is valid (a valid letter grade, as well as S/U capabilities).
+
If the letter grade is invalid, either `ModModBadSUException` or `ModBadGradeException` will be thrown.
+
Finally, the temporary module will be added to the `ModuleTaskList`, with the `letterGrade` included in its details.

* Case 2: Module is in the task list
If the module already exists in the task list, (i.e `ModuleTaskList` contains `moduleCode`) `GradeCommand` will simply check if the module can be S/U-ed, and update the `letterGrade` according to what the user inputs using the `setGrade` method.

****

Below is a Sequence Diagram showing how `GradeCommand` works.

image::GradeCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
*How GradeCommand executes*

Checks had to be implemented to check if the module can be S/U-ed, as well as if the `letterGrade` the user inputs is a valid grade according to NUS specifications.
These checks were implemented into the `ModuleInfoDetailed` class itself, which `ModuleTask` inherits as the baseline of the module task list. This way, other classes are able to use the methods and checks to set the letter grade for the respective module.

***

=== CapCommand
==== Current Implementation
The `cap` feature is operated by the `CapCommand` class, which is called by the `Parser` class. Upon user input of `cap TYPE`, the Parser will return a new `CapCommand`. +

Since `CapCommand` inherits the `ModuleCommand` class, it must override the `execute` method to specially execute the `cap` command. +

The parameter `TYPE` can take three forms according to the user input: +
****
* `cap overall` Where the user inputs modules of their choosing, as well as the letter grade, and the CAP is calculated accordingly.
* `cap list` Where the user's CAP is calculated from the modules with letter grades in the module task list.
* `cap module` Where the CAP of a module of the user's choosing can be calculated using the grades of prerequisite modules that the user has completed.
****

These `TYPE` parameters will be parsed by the `Parser` class and pass the corresponding argument of `toCap` into the `CapCommand` class. A switch case statement will handle the `toCap` argument, and choose to execute from three methods accordingly: +
`calculateOverallCap`,
`calculateListCap`
and
`calculateModuleCap` +

Upon construction of the `CapCommand` class, a few variables involved in calculating the CAP of the user are initialized, notably the users `mcCount`, `currentCap`, `projectedModuleCap` and `projectedCap`. These variables will be used in the three different ways CapCommand can currently execute in.

The user's CAP is calculated according to NUS guidelines, following the below specifications: +

image::CAPchart.png[align="center"]

image::CAPformula.png[align="center"]

As stated above, there are three methods that can be executed depending upon the `TYPE` the user inputs.

****
* Case 1: `cap overall` +
If the argument read for `toCap` is "overall", the `calculateOverallCap` method will be executed under the `execute` method. +
Firstly, a new `Scanner` will be created to continue reading in the modules and grades that the user wishes to calculate their CAP for. +
The user will be prompted to input a module and its respective letter grade. +
The user inputs are read in until the user inputs `done`, proceeding which the scanner will close and the calculation is done. +
Finally the user's CAP is calculated and printed.

* Case 2: `cap list` +
If the argument read for `toCap` is "list", the `calculateListCap` method will be executed under the `execute` method. +
This method calculates the CAP of modules from the user's `ModuleTaskList`.
** Note it will only take into account modules that have a letter grade attached to its details, and calculate the CAP accordingly. +

* Case 3: `cap module` +
If the argument read for `toCap` is "module", the `calculateModuleCap` method will be executed under the `execute` method. +
This method calculates the CAP of modules from the user's completed prerequisites in their `ModuleTaskList`. +
Firstly, a new `Scanner` will be created to continue reading in the module that the user wishes to calculate a predicted CAP for. +
After taking in the user input, ModPlan will check if the module is a legitimate module in the `detailedMap` pulled from NUSMODS API. +
If it is invalid, a new `ModNotFoundException` will be thrown. Otherwise the prerequisite tree (if any) will be scanned for that particular module using the `parsePrerequisiteTree` method. +

This method uses the string split method to parse the string of prerequisites into individual module codes, and sorts them into a List of Lists of Strings (LLS). 

Each List of Strings (LS) contains prerequesite modules as part of an 'or' tree, while the modules across the LLS are part of an 'and' tree. Once the methods finds one of the prerequisite modules in a LS that corresponds to a graded module taken in the user's module task list, it removes that LS entirely from the LLS, and moves on to check the next LS for any prerequisite modules taken. 

If the entire LLS is empty at the end of the execution, it means that the user has fulfilled enough of the prerequisite modules required for that module, and the user's CAP is calculated according to the graded prerequisite modules identified in the user's module task list. +

The diagram below shows the example more clearly, where only one of the prerequisites within a LS need to be taken, while all of prerequisites across the LLS need to be taken. +

image::CapCommandLLS.png[align="center"] 

In this case, the modules the user needs to take are: +

* One of moduleCode1, moduleCode2, moduleCode3 +
* moduleCode4 +
* moduleCode5 +
****

Below is a sequence diagram showing how `CapCommand` works. +

image::CapCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

=== SortCommand

==== Current implementation

The `sort` feature is operated by the `SortCommand` class, which is called by the `Parser` class. Upon user input of `sort TOSORT TYPE`, the Parser will return a new `SortCommand`.

Since `SortCommand` inherits the `ModuleCommand` class, it must override the `execute` method to specially execute the `SortCommand`. From the `Parser`, `SortCommand` also receives two additional variable inputs from the user: +

****
* The object to sort, e.g. modules or cca.
* The type of sorting the user specifies.
****

Below is a Sequence Diagram showing how `SortCommand` works.

image::SortCommandSequentialDiagram.png[width="600"]

=== ShowCommand

==== Current implementation

The `show` feature is opearted by the `ShowCommand` class, which is called by the `Parser` class. Upon user input of `show TYPE`, the Parser will return a new `ShowCommand`. +

Since `ShowCommand` inherits the `ModuleCommand` class, it must override the `execute` method to specially execute the `show` command. +

The parameter `TYPE` can take five forms according to the user input: + 
****
* `show cca`
* `show core`
* `show ge`
* `show ue`
* `show module`
****

These `TYPE` parameters will be parsed by the `Parser` class and pass the corresponding argument of `toShow` into the `ShowCommand` class. A switch case statement will handle the `toShow` argument.

Upon construction of the `ShowCommand` class, one variable is involved in the generation of the report are initiazlised, which refers to the `coreModList`. This variable is being used to store the strings of core modules taken by CEG students throughout the four years. The list of core modules are being taken from the NUS module requirements website. +

As stated above, there are five methods that can be executed depending on the `TYPE` that the user inputs.

****
* Case 1: `show cca` +
If the arguement read for `toShow` is "cca", an iterator iterates through the array list of `ccas`, which includes the CCAs added, and prints it out.

* Case 2: `show core` +
If the arguement read for `toShow` is "core", an iterator loops through the array list of `ModuleTask` and checks it against the set of `coreModList`. If the `moduleCode` in `ModuleTask` matches the `moduleCode` from the `coreModList`, that `moduleCode` is being printed out. 

** The second part subtracts the number of core modules taken from the total number of core modules required to be taken, which the information is taken from the NUS module requirements website. Hence, it shows the users the number of core modules left to take for the rest of the years.

* Case 3: `show ge` +
If the arguement read for `toShow` is "ge", an iterator loops through the array list of `ModuleTask` and checks the starting two letters of the `moduleCode`. If the `moduleCode` starts with a "GE", it is classified as a General Elective(GE) module and will be printed out.

** The second part subtracts the number of GE modules taken from the total number of GE modules required to be taken, which the information is taken from the NUS module requirements website. Hence, it shows the users the number of GE modules left to take for the rest of the years.

* Case 4: `show ue` +
If the arguement read for `toShow` is "ue", an iterator loops through the array list of `ModuleTask`. It checks the starting two letters of the `moduleCode` and also checks the `moduleCode` against the set of `coreModList`. If the `moduleCode`  does not match the `moduleCode` from the `coreModList` and it does not start with a `GE`, it is classified as a Unrestricted Elective(UE) module and will be printed out.

** The second part subtracts the number of UE modules taken from the total number of UE modules required to be taken, which the information is taken from the NUS module requirements website. Hence, it shows the users the number of UE modules left to take for the rest of the years.

* Case 5: `show module` +
If the arguement read for `toShow` is "module", an iterator loops through the array list of `ModuleTask`. It then prints out the entire list of modules being added.
****

Below is a Sequence Diagram showing how `ShowCommand` works.

image::ShowCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="600"]

=== JsonWrapper

==== Current implementation

`JsonWrapper` contains our usage of the `Gson` library for JSON file processing, as well as to call `RequestsData` to obtained the module data consolidated by `NUSMODS API`.

To prevent multiple requests to NUSMODS, our implementation would check if the user has previously downloaded the module data before. If they have only, only then would `JsonWrapper` call `RequestsData` to initialize the module data file.

image::PackageCrawler.png[]

Since `Gson` is able to internally read a JSON file and when given the same template within a Java object class, it would be able to map the value fields to each of the same keys in the Java Object.

This allows us to have a direct access to all the modules which are currently offered in NUS, by reading the returned JSON string and parsing it directly into a list of Module information. Since the data had to be modelled, the +
following ModuleInfoDetailed and ModuleInfoSummary was created to capture the data in the JSON file to be used during runtime.

image::PackageModule.png[]

Since certain modules may not contain data for every field, each of the module classes above are required to have default values on startup so as to prevent `NullPointerExceptions` during runtime when such data is accessed.
This also extends to choosing the right data type for modelling our module information, since certain fields maybe malformed and thus our implementation of the fields data type in module information classes would mostly contain `strings`, unless it is certain that
the data type found in the returned JSON string is strictly `boolean` or `double`.

To allow for quick access to the module information classes, after parsing of the module information into a list of `ModuleInfoDetailed`, it would then be converted into a `HashMap`, where the key-value pair
is the string containing the module code, and the value is the `ModuleInfoDetailed`. This is what is exposed to all the command classes during runtime, and this is done automatically on startup so that the module
data is accessible directly to the user.

==== RequestsData

Internally, this class is responsible for requesting data from the `NUSMODS API` and thus uses Java's Native `HTTPRequest` Library.

The current implementation is fixed to only request data for the current academic year, but this is subject to change in the coming versions to allow for users to choose to update the data once it gets outdated.

***

=== Cca

`Cca` is a class designed for managing user-defined CCAs. All instances of `Cca` are stored in a `List`-like structure `CcaList` which inherits from `ArrayList`.

==== Current implementation

`Cca` is a child class of a legacy class `TaskWithMultipleWeeklyPeriod` which belongs to one of our previous projects. Since `Cca` itself does not differ much from the parent class, it is recommended to refer to the parent class's implementation instead which can be found in <<Legacy>>.

==== Design consideration

It is generally not recommended to modify this class as it inherits from a legacy class. However, a fresh re-implementation might be considered so that the class itself can be customized more for `ModPlanner`.

== Product Scope

*A better module planner*

We aim to fulfill a need that is currently lacking in module planning, which in this case the is ability to plan ahead for more semesters up until graduation. Additional features would likely include the ability to generate a projection report for CAP computation and CCA planning.
